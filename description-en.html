<p>To create this ontology, we followed the methodology described in "Ontology Development 101: A Guide to Creating Your First Ontology" by Natalya F. Noy and Deborah L. McGuinness <a
	href="https://protege.stanford.edu/publications/ontology_development/ontology101.pdf" data-reference-type="autoref"
	data-reference="NoyandDeborahL">[1]</a>. According to this guide, the first step
of ontology development is to clarify the focus of the ontology. For
this purpose, three questions are defined, which will be answered in the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Which domain should be covered by the
ontology?</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The IoC Process Ontology should be able to cover the value chains of
the construction industry as comprehensively as possible. This includes
not only the design and construction phases, but also processes in all
phases of a structureâ€™s lifecycle.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>For what purpose should the ontology be
used?</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of the IoC Process Ontology is the valid description of
processes in the construction industry. This includes all types of
construction processes such as execution, planning, production,
logistics, and assembly processes. To achieve this, it is essential to
interrelate the processes and contextualize them with time and location
information. The IoC Construction Process Ontology serves as a top-level
ontology and enables the linking of more specific and detailed domain
ontologies. The modeled and mappable processes aim to digitalize and
optimize the construction industry information flow and encourage the
use of innovative AI and construction robotics solutions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>For what kind of questions should ontology be able to
provide answers?</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The IoC Process Ontology should be able to answer questions about the
nature of a process, its dependencies and its status. This should enable
simple interrelationships to be queried for roughly modeled processes,
and complex and detailed answers to be provided for use in process
control after further data input and with the inclusion of process data
feedback.

<h3 id="competencyQuestions" class="list">Competency questions <span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<p>
Competency questions are technical-functional in nature and describe
what queries should be able to answer precisly once the ontology has
been created. Therefore, they serve as the primary ontology development
procedure as they can be evaluated unambiguously. <a href="#tab:06"
data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="tab:06">Table 2</a> lists
the most relevant competency questions used in the development
process.

The formulated competency questions are used as a basis to work out
which areas of the ontology need to be covered by concepts and
relations, and which functionalities need to be enabled by the ontology.
The areas mentioned in <a href="#tab:06" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="tab:06">Table 2</a> indicate roughly the necessary
concepts of the ontology. Competency questions can also be used as a basis for evaluation. Within the
scope of the Internet of Construction research project, the evaluation of the IoC Process Ontology was of
great importance. Therefore, the ontology was extensively tested and
further developed on the basis of practical implementations at the
reference construction site of the RWTH Aachen University.

<p>The center of the IoC Process Ontology is the generic concept of the
<strong>process</strong>. The process is followed by the higher-level
concepts of the generic process modeling. The concepts correspond to the
domains that were developed using the competency Questions.
They are <em>process actor, process element, process
information, process method, process resource, process space,</em> and
<em>process status</em>. Concepts that can undergo a transformation by
executing the process distinguish by relations (object property) between
input and output concepts. An overview is depicted in <a
href="#fig:Abbildung03_11_2" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="fig:Abbildung03_11_2">Figure 1</a>.</p>

<p>The generic concepts of the IoC Process Ontology (ioc) do not contain
any taxonomic process classification. This is in order to achieve
independence from individual construction-related domains as well as
from international and national regulations and guidelines. All
concepts, regardless of the level of detail, can be provided with
metadata using concepts from PROV-O and SCHEMA, which are dynamically
used for versioning and evaluation. The main concepts and their
sub-concepts are described below.</p>
